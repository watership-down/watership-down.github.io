Born into the most desperate circumstances in slave-quarters in the deep South at the end of the nineteenth century, Daniel grows up a slave on a cotton plantation in the US. It seems he will remain there for the rest of his life, but things take a darker twist when he is sold as a consequence of killing the white overseer who his threatening his beloved sister. With his sinister new owner, Daniel embarks on a journey which will span continents, test his courage and endurance to the limit, and ultimately lead him to William Wilberforce and the campaign for the abolition of the slave trade.
