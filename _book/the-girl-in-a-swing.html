<p>A shy young man meets a beautiful woman on a business trip to Copenhagen. He is  swept off of his feet and his feelings are apparently returned. After a passionate courtship they are married, and he brings her with him to live in his family home in England. She is his erotic dream come true; she does everything she can to bind him to her and join him in his comfortable life. Soon, however, odd things begin to happen. Objects in his house become strangely damp with what looks like seawater, bodies appear under the water that aren't really there. What is the secret in his beloved's life? And what will become of their marriage?</p>
