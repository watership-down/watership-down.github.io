<p>Traveller, the war-horse of the great Confederate general Robert E. Lee is dreaming away his last months in a stable in retirement. Old and almost blind, his last remaining animal friend, Tom Cat, is his sole audience as he reminisces about the days of fear, courage, blood and horror in the camps and battlefields of the Civil War. Traveller describes the scenes of the war as a horse would sense them, and tries to draw out the dimly-understood threads of his beloved master's struggles against their deadly enemy - the Blue men.</p>
