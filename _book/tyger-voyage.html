<p>
	A phenomenal worldwide bestseller for over forty years, Richard Adamsâ€™ spellbinding classic Watership Down is one of the best-loved novels of all time.
</p>
<p>
	Set in the beautiful English countryside of the Berkshire Downs, a once idyllic rural landscape, this stirring tale of adventure, courage, and survival follows a band of very special rabbits fleeing the destruction of their home by a developer. Led by a stout-hearted pair of brothers, they leave the safety of Sandleford Warren in search of a safe haven and a mysterious promised land, skirting danger at every turn.
