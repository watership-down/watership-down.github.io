	A worldwide bestseller for more than thirty years, Watership Down is one of the most beloved novels of all time. Set in England's Downs, a once idyllic rural landscape, this stirring tale follows a band of very special creatures on their flight from the intrusion of man and the certain destruction of their home. Led by a stouthearted pair of brothers, they journey from their native Sandleford Warren through the harrowing trials posed by predators and adversaries, and toward the dream of a mysterious promised land and a more perfect society.
