“The Egg-box Dragon was my children's creation, really,” Adams recalls about a craft project dreamt up by one of his daughter's primary school teachers in the late 1960s. “It was someone's idea [to make a dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fRVW0Bynkw). The whole class used to amuse themselves by thinking up more and more ideas about Egg-box Dragon; how his tail was made; how his ears were made; what sort of stories he liked, and so on. I took it up and developed it, writing further stories about him.” [- The independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/watership-down-author-richard-adams-plans-to-release-his-first-picture-book-for-five-year-olds-a6941761.html)
