![A magpie](/images/posts/magpie.jpg)

Very high wind again - a nor'wester this time, howling on into the night. The magpies (plentiful as tabby cats, in point of fact, too many) seem undeterred by bany amount of wind. They take to the air in the gale, balancing with the help of their long tails, which they can partly open, and raise or lower almost to a right angle. I don't care for them - raffish, predatory creatures; 'can't sing either.

I turn to my old friend John Clare, that great poet, for a bit of a lift:

**Autumn**

I love the fitfull gusts that shakes  
 The casement all the day  
And from the mossy elm tree takes  
 The faded leaf away  
Twirling it by the window-pane  
With thousand others down the lane  

I love to see the shaking twig  
 Dance till the shut of eve  
The sparrow on the cottage rig  
 Whose chirp would make believe  
That spring was just now flirting by  
In summers lap with flowers to lie  

I love to see the cottage smoke  
 Curl upwards through the naked trees  
The pigeons nestled round the coat  
 On dull November days like these  
The cock upon the dung-hill crowing  
The mill sails on the heath agoing  

The feather from the ravens breast  
 Falls on the stubble lea  
The acorns near the old crows nest  
 Fall pattering down the tree  
The grunting pigs that wait for all  
Scramble and hurry where they fall.
