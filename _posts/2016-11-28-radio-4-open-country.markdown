A 2012 radio program, marking the 40th anniversary of Watership Down, explores the novel's inspirational setting and the issues it faces in the 21st century.

_"Helen Mark visits the Berkshire site made famous by author Richard Adams in Watership Down. Development is now planned in Sandleford near Newbury. A planning application to build 2,000 homes has met with opposition from the local community. However, West Berkshire Council says it needs to build more due to a housing shortage._

_To explore the issues and mark the 40th anniversary of the book&amps publication Helen retraces the landscape that follows the Berkshire/Hampshire border."_
