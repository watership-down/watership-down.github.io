Twilight at four o'clock, dark by twenty to five. Cold, too. I'm delighted to find that a sentence from 'Watership Down' appears in The Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations. 'Many human beings say that they enjoy the winter, but what they really enjoy is feeling proof against it'. Yes, indeed. Glad I'm not a rabbit at this time of year.
