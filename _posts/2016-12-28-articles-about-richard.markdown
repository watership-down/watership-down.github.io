We would like to say thank you for everyone's support, and the outpouring of kind words and tributes to Richard over the past few days. 

Of all the pieces written about Richard that we have seen, [this](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/28/richard-adams-writer-watership-down) was the one that most moved us and we'd like to share it with you.

_[&ldquo;In Watership Down, he created a book ahead of its time, a multi-layered novel that appealed to adults and children alike. But Adams was no one-hit wonder&rdquo;](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/28/richard-adams-writer-watership-down)_ - The Guardian
