- Watership Down

### Praise For Watership Down

_It’s a thrilling tale, and everything from the voice work to the direction aid in its multi-layered impact._
– Ben Travers, Watership Down, TV series, IndieWire, Dec 2018

_As much about freedom, ethics, and human nature as it is about a bunch of bunnies looking for a warm hidey-hole and some mates, Watership Down will continue to make the transition from classroom desk to bedside table for many generations to come._
- Paul Hughes
