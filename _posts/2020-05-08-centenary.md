_“All the world will be your enemy, Prince with a Thousand Enemies, and whenever they catch you, they will kill you. But first they must catch you, digger, listener, runner, prince with the swift warning. Be cunning and full of tricks and your people shall never be destroyed.”_  
    Watership Down

### Praise For Watership Down

_It’s a thrilling tale, and everything from the voice work to the direction aid in its multi-layered impact._  
    Ben Travers, Watership Down, TV series, IndieWire, Dec 2018

_As much about freedom, ethics, and human nature as it is about a bunch of bunnies looking for a warm hidey-hole and some mates, Watership Down will continue to make the transition from classroom desk to bedside table for many generations to come._  
    Paul Hughes
