// ---- HOW TO USE THIS SASS ARCHITECTURE ---- //

// ---- What to put in which directory ---- //

// HELPERS
// Contains all variables, functions, and mixins, etc.

// BASE
// Contains boilerplate stuff, including normalize, and basic stuff like
// setting margins for <p> and <h1>, setting default font size and color,
// things like that.

// LAYOUT
// Contains styles for the general structure of the site.
// Styles for things such as the header and footer go here - things that
// appears on (almost) every page.

// COMPONENTS
// Contains styles for components that may be used in various different
// places. For example, buttons, search bars, carousels.

// PAGES
// Contains page-specific styles, styles that are only required on ONE PAGE.
// For example, your home page will probably need a lot of styles that aren't
// reused anywhere else, that would go in pages/_home.scss.

// ---- What to do when you add new files ---- //

// In each folder, there is a single file with a corresponding name,
// eg: pages/_pages.scss. This file should import every other file in that
// folder. For subfolders, the same thing should happen,
// eg: helpers/variables/_variables.scss.

// default.scss should only ever contain imports. It should import the files in each
// folder that import all the files in the folder (if that sounds complicated, 
// just have a look at the code, it's v simple).
