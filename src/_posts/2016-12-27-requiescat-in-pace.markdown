Richard&rsquo;s much loved family announce with sadness that their dear father, grandfather, and great-grandfather passed away peacefully at 10pm on Christmas Eve.

&lsquo;It seemed to Hazel that he would not be needing his body any more, so he left it lying on the edge of the ditch, but stopped for a moment to watch his rabbits and to try to get used to the extraordinary feeling that strength and speed were flowing inexhaustibly out of him into their sleek young bodies and healthy senses. 

&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry about them,&rdquo; said his companion. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be alright - and thousands like them.&rdquo;&rsquo;

Richard George Adams, 9th May 1920 - 24th December 2016
