On Thursday night, Egg Box Dragon had another adventure. He travelled to Oxford for the launch of Richard's new book about his adventures with Emma, his creator, and how his special gift of finding lost objects came to the rescue of a number of very important people.

After an exciting evening at the brilliant Oxford Story Museum with a host of fans of all ages, Dragon spent the night in Jesus College and then made his way to Blackwells bookshop in Oxford, where he can now be seen in full splendour.
