Watership Down returns this Christmas in a new 4-part mini-series, brought to you by the BBC and Netflix. Each 50-minute episode follows one leg of the journey of the determined Hazel (James McAvoy) and insightful Fiver (Nicholas Holt), as they try to find and establish a home at the safe haven of Watership Down.

Richard Adams' best-selling book will be brought to life once again by an all-star cast also including Gemma Arterton, John Boyega, Olivia Colman, Sir Ben Kingsley, Daniel Kaluuya, Rosamund Pike, Peter Capaldi, Taron Egerton, Mackenzie Crook and more!
