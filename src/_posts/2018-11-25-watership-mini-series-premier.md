This weekend, London's BFI Southbank premiered episodes 1 and 2 of the upcoming BBC1 4-part Watership Down mini-series. Six years in the making, audience members had an early opportunity to return to Richard Adams' beloved novel, brought to life by an all-star cast of actors and Brown Bag Films' beautiful and distinctive animations.

During the credits, the audience were treated to the first public listening of Sam Smith's brand new song, Fire On Fire, written specifically for the show.

The two gripping episodes were followed by a Q&A featuring the show's director, writer, and producers, as well as cast members James McAvoy (Hazel), Gemma Arterton (Hyzenthlay), and Nicholas Holt (Fiver).

James spoke about how Watership Down was, along with Narnia, his favourite book, and showed off a t-shirt featuring the [french edition of Watership Down's stunning artwork](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Watership-Down-French-Richard-ADAMS-ebook/dp/B01I3JUA5Y).
