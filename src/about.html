			<h2>Richard Adams</h2>

			<p>Richard George Adams (9th May, 1920 – 24th December, 2016) was an English novelist best known as the author of Watership Down.</p>
			
			<p>He originally began telling the story of Watership Down to his two daughters, and they insisted he publish it as a book. When Watership Down was finally published, it sold over a million copies in record time in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Watership Down has become a modern classic and won both the Carnegie Medal and the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize in 1972.</p>
			
			<p>Others of his books include Shardik, Maia, Tales from Watership Down, The Girl in a Swing and The Plague Dogs, the last two of which, together with Watership Down, have been filmed. His goal was always to tell a good story, ideally one so good you can't put it down!</p>
			
			<p>Richard Adams lived in Hampshire, England. He has written about his childhood and youth, including the time he served in the army in World War II, in '<a href="/book/the-day-gone-by/">The Day Gone By</a>'.</p>
